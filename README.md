# Binary-Weights-MNIST-Classification

The purpose of this project is to develop a binary neural network (BNN) capable of recognizing the MNIST dataset. To achieve this, the dataset is first binarized, simplifying the information to binary values. The network consists of one hidden layers with 512 neurons. Backward propagation is applied through the sign function to adjust its weights. In order to optimize the training process and minimum the gradient descent, I use momentum algorithm and train it by minibatch. This allowing the network faster convergence. After implementing the binary neural network and training it on the binarized MNIST dataset, the accuracy of the model was measured. The final result achieved an accuracy of 80.78%.
